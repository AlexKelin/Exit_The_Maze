**Minesweeper Matrix Generator**

This Python program generates a Minesweeper game board of a user-defined size and applies mines according to a user-defined probability. It then attempts to find a straight path from the top to the bottom of the board, avoiding the mines.

**How to use**

The program is designed to create an n*n matrix using a search algorithm. To make the matrix more challenging, the program randomly assigns "mines" to certain fields based on the user's input probability.

Furthermore, the program is designed to determine if there is a path from the top layer to the bottom. This is a critical feature since the user must find a way to navigate the minefield without stepping on a mine. The program's algorithm ensures that the user is provided with a path to reach the bottom, thereby making the game more engaging and enjoyable.

In conclusion, this program is an exciting and challenging game that uses a search algorithm to create a minefield. It randomly assigns "mines" to specific fields based on the user's input probability and ensures that there is a path from the top layer to the bottom. This game is an excellent way to exercise the mind and enhance problem-solving skills while providing entertainment to users.

The code does not require any external libraries or modules.
