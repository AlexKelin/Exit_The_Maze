**Find Exit Matrix Generator**

This program generates an n*m matrix with empty fields in each row based on the user's input of the dimensions and probability coefficient. Its primary objective is to determine whether there exists a path from the top layer to the bottom of the matrix.

To run the program, execute the file in a Python environment. The program will prompt the user to enter the size of the matrix and the probability of a mine. If the user enters an invalid value, the program will ask them to input valid values.

An exquisite solution because I do not use brute force; the code looks for the exit in a single iteration through the matrix. 

The code does not require any external libraries or modules.
